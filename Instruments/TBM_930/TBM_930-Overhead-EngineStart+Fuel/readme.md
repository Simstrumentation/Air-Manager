## Notes:
    - As of 1-20-22 Starter switch in VC (SIM Virtural Cockpit) moves to ON for 3 seconds then moves to OFF 
      and doesn't allow you to turn starter OFF. This panel is working correctly and does allow starter to be turned off.
    - Ignition switch in VC does not move.
    - Fuel SEL is INOP due to commads not available.
