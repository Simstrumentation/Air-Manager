>[!IMPORTANT]  
>December 2024 Update
<h3 align="center">SimInnovations is in the process of bringing all of our Simstrumentation GitHub instruments into the AirManager store for (free) easy downloading in the next release of AirManager (AM5). They will be compatible with MSFS2020 and 2024 natively. Estimated release date is February 2025. In the mean time, several others have already git forked our repo and converted some instruments for MSFS2024, you'll find links to them in the chat on discord, or by looking at the forks of this repo.

</h3>
Our goal is to be able to offer flight simmers a quality collection of Air Manager (AM) instruments to enable a more realistic mouse and keyboard-free simulation experience. Through the use of touch screens and the optional <a href="https://www.siminnovations.com/hardware/product/57-knobster">Knobster</a> from Sim Innovations, you can have a fully interactive cockpit without requiring the use of a mouse in flight.
We build these instruments for our own use for our personal cockpits. But we've decided to share our work with the public free of charge so every AM user can benefit from our labour.
Ultimately, we want to have our instruments included in the AM community store (free to users with a valid license, of course) so that they're readily available directly from within the application. This GitHub repo won't be the download source, but will remain the hub around which we develop new instruments, collaborate with other community members who wish to participate in development, and test released before submitting to the AM Store.
<h6>NOTE - While the download and use of our instruments is free, AM is paid software available at https://www.siminnovations.com/. We are not associated with Sim Innovations in any way and cannot provide users with AM nor can we provide any technical support for AM. No warranties for our work are provided or implied. Our instruments hosted in this repo are offered as-is and are used at the end user's own risk

## Aircraft Instrument Categories

This is a list of the different aircraft in MSFS 2020 that we currently have working instruments for.
<h6>At the current time, we don't provide complete panel layouts, just individual instruments. Each person will have a different setup with a different number of monitors in different sizes. Preset panels that work for us won't necessarily work for you. You can use the instruments provided to build a layout that works for you.

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Simstrumentation/Air-Manager/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

Panel Names should not have spaces.
When Export out of AirManger remove the "-" that AirManager Exporter puts in between the Plane Name and Model.
